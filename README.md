# Pluralsight: A Functional Architecture (with Scala)

Exercise project for Pluralsights "A Functional Architecture with F#"
course by Mark Seemann, transcript to Scala. Course homepage is here:
https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/functional-architecture-fsharp

The code is not really close to the original demo project due to
very different ecosystems. I tried to transfer the main architecture
ideas:

- Command Query Separation
- Pipes & Filters for command processing
- Map/Reduce for query processing
- Reactive Streams
